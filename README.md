## Natural language processing for Icelandic

Try Reynir (in Icelandic) at [https://greynir.is](https://greynir.is)

*Reynir* is a proof-of-concept project that aims to
**extract processable information from Icelandic text** and allow
**natural language querying** of that information.

Reynir scrapes and tokenizes chunks of text from web pages
and parses the token streams according to a **hand-written context-free grammar**
for the Icelandic language. The resulting parse forests are disambiguated using
scoring heuristics to find the best parse trees. The trees are then stored in a
database and processed by grammatical pattern matching modules to obtain statements
of fact and relations between stated facts.

Reynir is most effective for text that is objective and factual, i.e. has a relatively high
ratio of concrete concepts such as numbers, amounts, dates, person and entity names,
etc.

Reynir is innovative in its ability to parse and disambiguate text written in a
**grammatically complex language**, such as Icelandic, which does not lend itself easily to statistical
parsing methods. Reynir uses grammatical features, i.e. cases, genders, persons (1st, 2nd, 3rd),
number (singular/plural) and various verb modes applied appropriately to nouns, verbs, adjectives
and prepositions to guide and disambiguate parses. Its optimized Earley-based parser is fast and
compact enough to make real-time while-you-wait analysis of web pages, as well as bulk processing,
feasible.

Reynir's goal is to "understand" text to a usable extent by parsing it into
structured, recursive trees that directly correspond to the original grammar.
These trees can then be further processed and acted upon by sets of Python
functions that are linked to grammar nonterminals.

**Reynir is currently able to parse about *85%* of sentences** in a typical news article from the web,
and many well-written articles can be parsed completely. It presently has about 33,000 parsed articles
in its database, containing 650,000 parsed sentences.

Reynir supports natural language querying of its databases. Users can ask about person names, titles and
entity definitions and get appropriate replies. The HTML5 Web Speech API is supported to allow
queries to be **recognized from speech** in enabled browsers, such as recent versions of Chrome.

Reynir may in due course be expanded, for instance:

* to make logical inferences from statements in its database;
* to find statements supporting or refuting a thesis; and/or
* to discover contradictions between statements.

## Implementation

Reynir is written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) except for its core
Earley-based parser module which is written in C++ and called
via [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).
Reynir runs on CPython and [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) with the latter being recommended.

Reynir works in stages, roughly as follows:

1. *Web scraper*, built on [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
  and [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) storing data
  in [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/).
2. *Tokenizer*, relying on the BÍN database of Icelandic word forms for lemmatization and
  initial POS tagging.
3. *Parser*, using an improved version of the [Earley algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser)
  to parse text according to an unconstrained hand-written context-free grammar for Icelandic
  that may yield multiple parse trees (a parse forest) in case of ambiguity.
4. *Parse forest reducer* with heuristics to find the best parse tree.
5. *Information extractor* that maps a parse tree via its grammar constituents to plug-in
  Python functions.
6. *Article indexer* that transforms articles from bags-of-words to fixed-dimensional
  topic vectors using [Tf-Idf](http://www.tfidf.com/) and
  [Latent Semantic Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis).
7. *Query processor* that allows natural language queries for entites in Reynir's database.

Reynir has an embedded web server that displays news articles recently scraped into its
databsae, as well as names of people extracted from those articles along with their titles. The web
UI enables the user to type in any URL and have Reynir scrape it, tokenize it and display the
result as a web page. Queries can also be entered via the keyboard or using voice input.
The server runs on the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework, implements WSGi and can
for instance be plugged into Gunicorn and Nginx.

Reynir uses the official BÍN ([Beygingarlýsing íslensks nútímamáls](http://bin.arnastofnun.is))
lexicon and database of Icelandic word forms to identify and tokenize words, and find their
grammatical roots and forms. The database has been downloaded from the official BÍN website and
stored in PostgreSQL.

The tokenizer divides text chunks into sentences and recognizes entities such as dates, numbers,
amounts and person names, as well as common abbreviations and punctuation.

Grammar rules are laid out in a separate text file, `Reynir.grammar`. The standard
[Backus-Naur form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form) has been
augmented with repeat specifiers for right-hand-side tokens (`*` for 0..n instances,
`+` for 1..n instances, or `?` for 0..1 instances). Also, the grammar allows for
compact specification of rules with variants, for instance due to cases, numbers and genders.
Thus, a single rule (e.g. `NounPhrase/case/gender → Adjective/case noun/case/gender`)
is automatically expanded into multiple rules (12 in this case, 4 cases x 3 genders) with
appropriate substitutions for right-hand-side tokens depending on their local variants.

The parser is an optimized C++ implementation of an Earley parser as enhanced by
[Scott and Johnstone](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642309000951),
referencing Tomita. It parses ambiguous grammars without restriction and
returns a compact Shared Packed Parse Forest (SPPF) of parse trees. If a parse
fails, it identifies the token at which no parse was available.

The Reynir scraper is typically run in a `cron` job every 30 minutes to extract articles automatically
from the web, parse them and store the resulting trees in a PostgreSQL database for further processing.

Scraper modules for new websites are plugged in by adding Python code to the `scrapers/` directory.
Currently, the `scrapers/default.py` module supports four popular Icelandic news sites as well
as the site of the Constitutional Council.

Processor modules can be plugged in to Reynir by adding Python code to the `processors/` directory.
The demo in `processors/default.py` extracts person names and titles from parse trees for
storage in a database table.
